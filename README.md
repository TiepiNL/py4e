# py4e - Python for Everyone MOOC

Tom's playground to practice Python.

## Coursera

I have followed the [Python for Everybody Specialization] (py4e) MOOC at Coursera. I use this repo to store my course assignments, and some small projects to practise (perhaps they once become repos on their own).

### Progress
