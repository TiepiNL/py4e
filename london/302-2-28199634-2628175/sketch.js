/*
The case of the slippery Minsky brothers
Stage 3: Gate’s Department Store

Officer: 2628175
CaseNum: 302-2-28199634-2628175

There’s been a break in at Gate’s Department Store. I suspect that it’s Marvin, the eldest Minsky. Catch this Minsky in the act and you’ll have the whole gang behind bars.

- Edit the spotlight object by creating x and y properties initialised to your location. Also endX and endY properties initialised to Marvin's location

- Make the spotlight move perfectly from you towards Marvin by adjusting the increments of the x and y properties.
  If you get everything correct then it will stop over the target.

  - Adjust x and y properties using

 * "+=" or "+"
 * "-=" or "-"
