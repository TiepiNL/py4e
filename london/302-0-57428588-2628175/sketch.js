The case of the slippery Minsky brothers
Stage 1: Gates Bank

CaseNum: 302-0-57428588-2628175

The Slippery Minsky brothers are notorious cat burglars.
I’ve been trying to catch them for years but they are masters of escape, hence their nickname.
I’ve had a tip off that Sergey Minsky is breaking into the Gates Bank tonight.
Head down there and catch him in the act.


- Edit startX to alter the starting position of the spotlight.

- Edit endX to stop the spotlight when it reaches the target.

- Make the spotlight move perfectly from you towards Sergy by adjusting the increments of x and y.
  If you get everything correct then it will stop over the target.

- Adjust x and y using

 * "+=" or "+"
 * "-=" or "-"
